                The natural phenomena of our planet can sometimes be considered as boring for the 
                majority of people, but well presented they can appeal and make people reconsider 
                all the other "boring" subject as maybe not so boring.

            <h2>
                3 types of cloud
            </h2>
            <p>
                There is 3 types of cloud and they are classified based on the height of the cloud 
                from the surface of the earth.
                <br>
                It gives us:
                <tr>
                <li><strong>Low</strong> clouds, the closer from the surface of the earth.</li>
                <li><strong>Middle</strong> clouds, higher than the lowers ones.</li>
                <li><strong>High</strong> clouds, even higher than the middle ones.</li>
